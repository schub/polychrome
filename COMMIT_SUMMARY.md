## Motivation & Problems Addressed

### Original Architecture Problems

The refactor addresses several critical architectural challenges that had accumulated over time:

#### 1. **Tangled Responsibilities**
- The `Mixer` module had become a monolithic component handling both visual mixing AND app lifecycle management
- App selection logic was scattered across multiple modules
- No clear separation between rendering concerns and app management

#### 2. **Protocol Leakage Throughout System**
- Applications were directly consuming protobuf events (`InputEvent`, `ProximityEvent`, `SoundToLightControlEvent`)
- Network protocol knowledge was scattered throughout the application layer
- Changes to network protocols required updates across many application files

#### 3. **Complex Event Structures**
- Apps had to understand low-level protobuf formats designed for network efficiency
- Inconsistent event handling patterns across different event types
- Missing semantic meaning in event structures (e.g., `AXIS_X_1` instead of meaningful directions)

#### 4. **Poor Developer Experience**
- New app developers had to learn protobuf schemas before writing business logic
- Event handling required boilerplate conversion code in every app
- Difficult to test apps due to complex protobuf event construction

#### 5. **Maintenance Burden**
- Protocol changes rippled through the entire application layer
- Inconsistent event handling patterns made debugging difficult
- No centralized conversion logic led to code duplication

---

## Phase 1: App Management Separation

### Objective
Extract app lifecycle management from the `Mixer` to establish clear architectural boundaries.

### Key Changes

#### **New Component: `AppManager`**
**File**: `octopus/lib/octopus/app_manager.ex` (NEW)

```elixir
# Clean API for app management
AppManager.select_app(app_id)
AppManager.get_selected_app()
AppManager.subscribe()  # For lifecycle events
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Centralized app selection and lifecycle management
- APP_SELECTED/APP_DESELECTED event distribution
- Dual-side app support (for games like Blocks)
- PubSub notifications for UI updates

#### **Mixer Simplification**
**File**: `octopus/lib/octopus/mixer.ex`

**Removed responsibilities:**
- App selection logic
- App lifecycle event handling
- App state management

**Retained focus:**
- Visual frame mixing and transitions
- Canvas composition
- Rendering pipeline optimization

### Benefits Achieved
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module now has a clear, focused purpose
- **Testability**: App management logic can be tested independently of rendering
- **Maintainability**: Changes to app selection don't affect rendering logic

---

## Phase 2: System Integration

### Objective
Update all system components to use the new `AppManager` instead of directly interfacing with the `Mixer` for app management.

### Components Updated

#### **Events Router Integration**
**File**: `octopus/lib/octopus/events/router.ex`
- Routes events to currently selected app via `AppManager.get_selected_app()`
- Centralized event distribution logic

#### **Web Interface Updates**
**Files**: `octopus_web/live/pixels_live.ex`, `octopus_web/live/apps_live.ex`
- Subscribe to `AppManager` events instead of `Mixer`
- Cleaner separation between UI state and app state

#### **System Components**
**Files**: Various system components
- Updated to query `AppManager` for app selection
- Removed direct coupling to `Mixer` for non-rendering concerns

### Architecture Improvement
```
Before: [UI] ←→ [Mixer] ←→ [Apps]
                   ↕
               [Everything]

After:  [UI] ←→ [AppManager] ←→ [Apps]
                     ↓
                 [Mixer] (rendering only)
```

---

## Phase 3: Controller Event Abstraction

### Objective
Create a clean domain event for controller input that shields apps from protobuf complexity.

### Key Changes

#### **New Domain Event: `ControllerEvent`**
**File**: `octopus/lib/octopus/controller_event.ex` → `octopus/lib/octopus/events/event/controller.ex`

```elixir
# Clean, semantic event structure
%ControllerEvent{
  type: :button,
  button: 1,
  action: :press
}

%ControllerEvent{
  type: :joystick,
  joystick: 1,
  direction: :left  # Semantic, not :AXIS_X_1
}
```

#### **Protocol Conversion Layer**
**File**: `octopus/lib/octopus/input_adapter.ex`

**Before**: Apps received raw protobuf
```elixir
%InputEvent{type: :AXIS_X_1, value: -1}  # Cryptic
```

**After**: Apps receive semantic events
```elixir
%ControllerEvent{type: :joystick, joystick: 1, direction: :left}  # Clear
```

#### **Application Updates**
All 19 applications updated to use semantic events:
- **pixel_fun.ex**: Simplified joystick handling with clear direction semantics
- **senso.ex**: Cleaner button event matching
- **bomber_person.ex**: Improved game control logic

### Benefits for Apps
- **Semantic Clarity**: `direction: :left` instead of `type: :AXIS_X_1, value: -1`
- **Type Safety**: Structured events with clear field meanings
- **Future-Proof**: Protocol changes don't affect app code

---

## Phase 4: Complete Domain Event Migration

### Objective
Migrate all remaining protobuf events to clean domain events, establishing a complete domain event system.

### Phase 4A: Controller Event Structure Migration

#### **Module Reorganization**
- Moved `ControllerEvent` to new hierarchy: `Octopus.Events.Event.Controller`
- Added validation functions for event integrity
- Updated 27 files with minimal changes using aliases

### Phase 4B: Proximity Event Domain Wrapper

#### **New Domain Event: `ProximityEvent`**
**File**: `octopus/lib/octopus/events/event/proximity.ex` (NEW)

```elixir
# Before: Protobuf with awkward field names
%ProximityEvent{panel_index: 0, sensor_index: 1, distance_mm: 150.0}

# After: Clean domain event with helpers
%Proximity{
  panel: 0,
  sensor: 1, 
  distance_mm: 150.0,
  timestamp: 1634567890123
}

# With helpful functions
Proximity.in_range?(event, 0, 100)  # true/false
Proximity.sensor_id(event)          # "panel_0_sensor_1"
```

### Phase 4C: Audio Event Domain Migration

#### **New Domain Event: `AudioEvent`**
**File**: `octopus/lib/octopus/events/event/audio.ex` (NEW)

```elixir
# Before: Confusing name and raw protobuf
%SoundToLightControlEvent{bass: 0.8, mid: 0.5, high: 0.3}

# After: Clear name and rich domain event
%Audio{
  bass: 0.8,
  mid: 0.5, 
  high: 0.3,
  timestamp: 1634567890123
}

# With domain-specific helpers
Audio.intensity(event)              # 0.8 (max frequency)
Audio.dominant_frequency(event)     # :bass
Audio.normalized_spectrum(event)    # {1.0, 0.625, 0.375}
```

#### **Factory Pattern Implementation**
**File**: `octopus/lib/octopus/events/factory.ex` (NEW)

Centralized conversion logic keeping protocol knowledge out of domain events:

```elixir
# Clean separation of concerns
Factory.create_controller_event(protobuf_input)    # InputEvent → Controller
Factory.create_proximity_event(protobuf_proximity) # ProximityEvent → Proximity  
Factory.create_audio_event(protobuf_audio)         # SoundToLightControlEvent → Audio
```

### Clean Architectural Boundaries

1. **Network Boundary**: Protocol conversion happens here and only here
2. **Domain Layer**: Rich events with business meaning and helper functions
3. **Application Layer**: Pure business logic, no protocol concerns

---

## Benefits for Application Developers

### 1. **Dramatically Simplified Event Handling**

#### **Before**: Complex protobuf understanding required
```elixir
def handle_input(%InputEvent{type: :AXIS_X_1, value: value}, state) when value < 0 do
  # What does AXIS_X_1 with negative value mean?
  # Developer must understand joystick axis mapping
  {:noreply, %{state | player_x: state.player_x - 1}}
end
```

#### **After**: Semantic, self-documenting events
```elixir
def handle_input(%Controller{type: :joystick, direction: :left}, state) do
  # Crystal clear: joystick moved left
  {:noreply, %{state | player_x: state.player_x - 1}}
end
```

### 2. **Rich Domain Events with Helper Functions**

#### **Audio Events Example**
```elixir
def handle_input(%Audio{} = audio, state) do
  case Audio.dominant_frequency(audio) do
    :bass -> trigger_bass_effect(state)
    :mid  -> trigger_mid_effect(state) 
    :high -> trigger_treble_effect(state)
  end
  
  intensity = Audio.intensity(audio)
  {:noreply, %{state | brightness: intensity}}
end
```

#### **Proximity Events Example**
```elixir
def handle_proximity(%Proximity{} = event, state) do
  if Proximity.in_range?(event, 0, 50) do
    trigger_close_interaction(event, state)
  else
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

### 3. **Type Safety and Validation**

```elixir
# Events are validated at creation
Audio.validate(audio_event)  # :ok | {:error, :invalid_audio_event}

# Struct enforcement prevents errors
%Controller{type: :invalid}  # Compile-time error
```

### 4. **Testing Made Simple**

#### **Before**: Complex protobuf construction
```elixir
test "handles joystick left" do
  event = %InputEvent{type: :AXIS_X_1, value: -1}
  # What does this even test?
end
```

#### **After**: Clear, readable test events
```elixir
test "handles joystick left" do
  event = %Controller{type: :joystick, direction: :left}
  # Perfectly clear what's being tested
end
```

### 5. **Future-Proof Application Code**

- **Protocol Changes**: Don't affect apps (conversion happens in Factory)
- **New Event Types**: Can be added without touching existing apps
- **Enhanced Events**: New helper functions benefit all apps automatically

---

## Legacy Code Analysis

### Remaining Considerations

We identified one area of architectural inconsistency:

#### **Internal System Events**
- `ControlEvent` (APP_SELECTED/APP_DESELECTED) still uses protobuf directly
- These are **internal system lifecycle events**, not external input
- Created by `AppManager`, consumed by apps for lifecycle notifications

#### **Design Decision Made**
We chose to keep internal system events as protobuf because:
- They're purely internal (no network boundary crossing)
- Conversion overhead isn't justified for internal communication
- Clear distinction: **External events → Domain**, **Internal events → Protobuf**

---

## Technical Statistics

### Code Changes Summary
- **42 files modified** across all phases
- **4 new domain event modules** created
- **1 new Factory module** for conversion logic
- **1 new AppManager module** for lifecycle management
- **All 19 applications** updated to use domain events
- **Zero breaking changes** to external protocols

### Lines of Code Impact
- **Significant reduction** in protocol-aware code across apps

## Conclusion

This comprehensive refactor represents a fundamental improvement in the Octopus system's architecture. By establishing clear boundaries between network protocols, system management, and application logic, we've created a more maintainable, testable, and developer-friendly system.

### Key Achievements

1. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined boundaries
2. **Developer Experience**: Apps work with semantic, business-focused events
3. **Maintainability**: Protocol changes don't ripple through application code
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new event types and helper functions
5. **Backward Compatibility**: No disruption to existing external integrations

### For the Team

This refactor touches code originally written by many team members, but the changes are overwhelmingly positive:

- **Your app logic becomes cleaner and more focused**
- **Event handling is now self-documenting**
- **Testing is dramatically simplified**
- **Future changes will be easier to implement**
- **New team members can understand events immediately**

The investment in this refactor pays dividends in reduced complexity, improved maintainability, and enhanced developer productivity. Every application developer will benefit from working with clean, semantic domain events instead of low-level protocol structures.
